## Things to do 

* Start learning from saved data

* Set epsilon-greedy method more elaborately(Agent should explore even after learned a lot)

* Conduct experiments to test various learning methods


## Questions

* Changing reward values affects learning? 

* How to accelerate learning in the early stages?
